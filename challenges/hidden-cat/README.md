# Hidden Cat Flag
Category: stego
Difficulty: Easy

This is a regular cat image, but something is hidden inside. Try simple commands like strings or examine the end of the file.

**Hint:**

The flag isn’t in the visible image; it’s hiding somewhere in the file.
Sometimes important info is appended after the image data.
Look at the end of the file with a tool that shows raw bytes.

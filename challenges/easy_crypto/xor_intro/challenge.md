# XOR Intro

## Story
We intercepted a short message protected with a homemade XOR-based scheme.
All we have is a hex-encoded ciphertext.

## Goal
Recover the original plaintext and extract the flag.

## Provided
- `files/ciphertext.txt` (hex-encoded ciphertext)

## Notes
- Everything can be solved locally.
- Flag format: `FLAG{...}`
